# SkySentinel  
**Unmanned Aerial Intrusion Trapping System**  

SkySentinel is an innovative IoT-based solution designed to detect and safely neutralize unauthorized drone intrusions using advanced sensor technology and a custom trapping mechanism.  

## Features  
- **Detection**: Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect the presence of drones within its operational range.  
- **Neutralization**: Employs a custom-designed net mechanism powered by a spring system to safely trap and immobilize drones.  
- **Autonomous Operation**: Operates without human intervention, ensuring rapid and effective response to aerial intrusions.  

## Role  
- **Lead Designer and Ideator**: Conceptualized the system and led the design and development of SkySentinel.  

## Development  
- Developed using the ESP-32 microcontroller for its robust IoT capabilities.  
- Used ultrasonic sensors for precise detection.  
- Designed a spring-based net system for safe and efficient drone neutralization.  

## How It Works  
1. **Detection**: The ultrasonic sensors continuously monitor the surroundings for drone activity.  
2. **Response**: Upon detection, the system calculates the position and deploys the net mechanism.  
3. **Capture**: The spring system launches a net to trap the drone securely, minimizing potential damage.  

## Purpose  
SkySentinel addresses the growing concern of unauthorized drone activity in sensitive areas, providing a safe and efficient solution for aerial intrusion prevention.  

## Event Participation  
- Successfully showcased in the **Innovation Challenge** conducted by the **ED-Cell of Silicon University, Odisha**, receiving recognition for its practical design and impactful application.
